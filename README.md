# Diabetics Prediction using Machine Learning Techniques

## Overview

This project uses the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on a set of features such as age, BMI, glucose levels, etc. The SVM model is trained on a labeled dataset containing historical health data.

## Project Structure

- `diabetes_prediction.py`: Python script containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- `diabetes_dataset.csv`: CSV file containing the dataset used for training and testing the SVM model.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required to run the project.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas
- NumPy

You can install them using pip with the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
